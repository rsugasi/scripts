You must have heard this mindfulness experiment done in harvard univeristy in US.
They measured this sleep pattern as well as this meditation pattern by measuring 
this EEG graph.
This mind activity, mental activity reflects..is reflected in various wave patterns
like when I am awake my mind activity is measured in certain waves...Alpha waves, Beta 
waves..All these waves are measured with their frequencies and the depth of it.
During sleep there is a special pattern. During deep sleep there is a special pattern.
During dream state there is a special pattern. 
Their conclusion was..those who meditate will get into this deep sleep state very fast.
But in SM, something different happens, where during even your first few minutes of 
meditation where you have not gone so deep also.. but that wave appears.
1:15 It shows that you are fully aware of first few minutes of your sitting but the wave 
is like a deep sleep state.
and this result ahh is not a speciality of a monk who has been meditating for 20 years or 25 years.
But these wave pattern of Turiya condition in manifested even during the first sitting in SM.
1:46 And this has everything to do with transmission.
So we are embarking upon this new researches, scientific approach that is helping us prove 
that yes transmission is something ahh nothing to be laughed about...nothing to be of..you can be
suspicious about. It is provable on scientific machines.
2:17 But machine can measure only so much
